In this work, was developed a graphical user interface for use by the web, using PHP and shell-script languages, in order to facilitate the configuration and monitoring of different services required on a network server, such as firewall, DHCP, squid/proxy, DNS, e-mail, among others, was developed in this paper. For this, was used a strategy for developing modular for easy of use and allows the addition of new modules later. The tool was developed entirely with free software and allows access to your code changes according to user needs.
